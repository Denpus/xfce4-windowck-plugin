FAQ:
Q: How do I hide the window decorations on maximized windows on xfce ?
A: You can use a patch for xfwm4 available here : https://github.com/cedl38/xfwm4-titleless. Alternatively, you can try to use an external program like maximus (performance should be lower).
There are also some xfwm4 themes with very thin border like this one :

This code is derived from original 'Window Applets' from Andrej Belcijan.
See http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=103732 for infos.
